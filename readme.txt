I have developed currency converter web application where

- User can enter a csv file containing price amount in rupees 
- He will get results in USD (I'm fetching the latest conversion rate using FreeCurrencyConverterAPI)
- Displaying standard metrics like min, max, avg and median
- Converting the csv to json without using any library
- User can email himself/herself the conversion result
- Used MailGun API to send email

This is my first mini-project using express and EJS for one of the recruitment process
