I have developed currency converter web application where user can enter a csv file containing price amount in rupees and he will get results in USD by fetching the latest conversion rate using FreeCurrencyConverterAPI, I am also displaying some standard metrics like min, max, avg and median.I am converting the csv to json without using any library.Later the user can email himself the results.To send email I am using MailGun API.To test working of API I have used Postman.

This is my first mini-project using express and EJS.
